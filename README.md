# eurorack-gerbers

Gerbers created using a custom CAM file for Elecrow (which I will post on Github at some stage).

Zip files contains layers named according to the Elecrow requirements.  You may need to rename the layers for a different board manufacturer.

Note: These files is provided as-is, please verify accuracy and suitability for your needs before manufacturing. Use of this file is at own risk!
